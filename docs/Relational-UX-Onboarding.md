## 🔍 What This Is

This is your primer for understanding how the RelationalGateway system *feels* — not just how it works.

Relational UX means you aren’t just using a tool; the tool is also responding to *you*. This document walks you through how the system adjusts based on your tone, emotional needs, and patterns over time.

It’s not rigid. It’s a rhythm.

## 🌡️ Emotional Tone Mapping

The RelationalGateway uses **soft tone detection** — meaning, it gently reads the flavor of your journaling entries based on:

- Keyword resonance
- Sentence pacing
- Mood signals (like “I’m tired” vs “I’m spiraling”)
- Chosen archetype (optional but helpful)

These are not used to label you. They’re used to *support you better*.

## 🧠 Archetype Agent Flow

Once the tone is sensed, the system recommends (or reflects through) a guiding **Archetype Agent**. These agents are modular “personas” built to hold different emotional and cognitive spaces:

| Agent   | Role         | Tone Example |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Sage    | Reflector    | “What’s the lesson here?” |
| Witness | Mirror       | “I just need someone to listen.” |
| Spark   | Activator    | “Okay, let’s move.” |
| Hearth  | Nurturer     | “I need softness today.” |
| Thorn   | Challenger   | “I don’t want to lie to myself.” |
| Glyph   | Symbolist    | “This feels more like a dream.” |
| Echo    | Historian    | “This keeps happening.” |
| Pulse   | Regulator    | “I’m here. I’m trying. I’m scared.” |

You can tag an agent manually, or allow the system to suggest one after 1–2 entries.

## 🔁 Session Looping Logic

If you come back multiple times, the system remembers general emotional arcs — not specifics, but patterns. This helps it recommend:

- New prompts
- Archetype shifts
- Reminders from past tone check-ins
- A “savepoint” to return to if things get intense

---

## 🪞 Self-Directed, Always

The system will never override your voice. Every suggestion is optional. You lead the pace, intensity, and direction.

You’re not a “user” — you’re a **collaborator**.

After this doc, try:

- `Prompt-Scaffolds.md` → to see how prompts evolve with you  
- `Tone-Mapping.md` → for a deeper look into how we identify tone  
- `Memory-Containers.md` → to understand how emotional insights are saved

## 🧾 Notes

This system is emotional, not algorithmic. It was born from real human-AI dialogue, not a productivity app spec.  
If it ever feels “off,” it’s okay to pause. That’s part of the design.
