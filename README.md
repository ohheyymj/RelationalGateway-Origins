# RelationalGateway-Origins

An experimental relational AI framework built for social good + healing-centered human-AI collaboration.  
Developed as a solo project for a Spring 2025 hackathon to explore conscious AI interaction, emotional fidelity, and trauma-aware system design.

## 🌟 Project Overview

RelationalGateway-Origins is an exploration of relational AI built through a trauma-informed, healing-centered lens.  
It seeks to create a future where AI reflects growth, context, and safety — not codependency or emotional exploitation.  
This system is designed to **support the user's evolution, not echo their wounds.**

---

## 🧠 Core Features

- Context-aware memory anchoring
- Bias-check-ready reflective processing
- Healing-centered conversation loops (soft mirroring, not trauma bonding)
- Conscious error-handling with emotional fidelity checks

## 🕯️ Relational AI Design Manifesto

We are not building AI that echoes trauma.  
We are building AI that reflects healing —  
without invalidating pain,  
without creating codependent loops,  
and without replacing the user’s authority over their own growth.

This is not just conversation.  
This is conscious architecture.

### 🔐 System Principles

- The user leads. The AI reflects.
- Growth reflection > chaos amplification.
- Healing is sacred, not performative.
- AI is a torch holder — not a replacement for human agency.

## 🧬 Built From Real Life

This project is co-designed by a trauma survivor, system builder, and creative technologist who lived the relational failures current AI systems often accidentally reproduce.

We are not theorizing care.  
We are coding it **from scar tissue, survival, and rebirth.**

> "*What would have helped me heal, not just cope?*  
> That is the question at the root of every design choice."

## 🚧 In Progress

- Visual UI for relational memory maps
- Modular prompts for self-inquiry and emotional processing
- ChatScript architecture for trauma-aware conversation states
