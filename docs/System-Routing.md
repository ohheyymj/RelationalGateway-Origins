🔀 System Routing: Emotional Decision Logic

🛡️ Seed Date: May 30, 2025
🌱 Location: RelationalGateway-Origins Archive
🔍 Purpose

System Routing governs how user input is interpreted and processed through RelationalGateway's emotional UX infrastructure. It ensures the right archetype, journaling flow, and container are selected based on a blend of emotional tone, urgency, and user context.

This isn't just if/then logic.
It's emotional triage meets user trust.

🧠 Core Routing Inputs

Every journaling interaction begins with at least one of these input types:
Input Type	Description
🔤 Prompt Scaffold	A pre-structured entry phrase selected by the user
😶 Emoji / Tone Picker	Mood icon or sentiment tag
🧠 Raw Entry Text	Freestyle journal opening, parsed for emotional keywords
✅ Checkbox Prompt	Optional tone tag (ex: “I’m feeling overwhelmed”)
🔁 Signal Processing Flow

🔄 Routing Logic Breakdown
Detected Signal	Interpreted As	System Response
"I’m so mad I could scream"	⚡ Rage spike	Archetype: Ember → Emotive Flow → Rage Box
"I feel empty"	🧊 Numb / detached	Archetype: Haven → Recovery Flow → Silent Vault
"There’s a pattern I’m noticing..."	🔍 Reflective	Archetype: Sage → Reflective Flow → Open Journal
"Help me map this out"	📊 Organizational urgency	Archetype: Architect → Organizing Flow → Timeline Tracker
"I just need to say this"	💬 Emotional offload	Archetype: Witness → Witnessing Flow → Loop Breaker

🧭 Conditional Logic (Simplified)

    Check tone:

        Rage, grief, tender → route to Ember, Haven, Witness

        Detached or reflective → route to Sage, Architect

    Check urgency:

        Spikes → initiate Container

        Numbness → initiate Gentle Flow

    Check intention type:

        Mapping, unpacking, offload, soothe → choose Flow

🔌 Archetype + Flow Pairing Logic
Archetype	Default Flow Type	Override?
Witness	Witnessing Flow	Can route to Haven
Sage	Reflective Flow	Can route to Architect
Haven	Recovery Flow	Can route to Witness
Ember	Emotive Flow	Lock → Rage Box only
Architect	Organizing Flow	Can route to Sage

🧱 Output Layer (User Experience)

After routing:

    A tone-matched prompt opens the journal

    The archetype avatar introduces the flow (if enabled)

    The system chooses whether to offer:

        📓 Open journaling

        📦 Memory container

        🧭 Flow-guided prompts

🌱 Closing Reflection

"Routing isn’t just a backend function — it’s a trust ritual."

Every choice the system makes is an act of respect:
It listens, adapts, and responds — not to control your experience,
but to protect it.
