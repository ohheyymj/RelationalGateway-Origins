This guide offers everything you need to begin.

## 🧾 Notes for Testers

This system is in active evolution.  
It’s built around care, presence, and trust. If it ever feels like too much — pause. That’s part of the design. Silence is honored here.

You’re not being judged.  
Your presence — even quiet — is feedback.

---

## 🕯️ Thank You

This isn’t just a product. It’s a **living framework**.  
Your voice helps keep it human-first, emotionally honest, and truly relational.
