🔍 Purpose

Tone Mapping is the process of decoding emotional signals at the start of a journaling session to determine routing logic — including archetype selection, flow path, and container suggestion.

It’s not just about how you feel.
It’s how your field presents that feeling to the system.

This is where relational design meets energetic intelligence.

🌐 How Tone Mapping Works

At the beginning of each journaling session, users check in with their emotional state using one of the following:

    An emoji-based selector (Notion toggle, tag, or icon)

    A sentence starter chosen from Prompt Scaffolds

    A tone keyword typed into the entry box

The system then interprets that signal using three core dimensions:
Category	Examples	Outcome
Emotional Tone	Calm, numb, anxious, furious, tender	Routes to archetype (e.g., Haven or Ember)
Energetic Urgency	Slow, spiraling, flared, still	Adjusts pacing and flow intensity
Containment Need	Overwhelmed, avoidant, explosive	Suggests container (e.g., Silent Vault)

🧭 Sample Tone Map & Routing
User Input	Detected Tone	Assigned Archetype	Suggested Flow	Container
“I don’t even know where to start.”	Overwhelmed	Witness	Witnessing Flow	Loop Breaker
“Something’s been on my mind…”	Reflective	Sage	Reflective Flow	Open journal
“I feel like I’m going to explode.”	Rage spike	Ember	Emotive Flow	Rage Box
“I feel numb.”	Detached	Haven	Recovery Flow	Silent Vault
“I want to understand this.”	Curious	Architect	Organizing Flow	Timeline Builder

🧠 Why Tone Mapping Matters

This isn’t just mood tracking.

Tone Mapping allows the journaling system to:

    Create emotionally intelligent UX routes

    Offer safety-first journaling suggestions

    Avoid mismatch between user energy and system tone

    Build user trust through consistency and resonance

It also sets the stage for future integration with:

    AI tone classifiers

    Emotional pacing adjustments

    Journal reflection loopbacks

🌱 Closing Reflection

    “Emotion is not noise. It’s navigation.”

Tone Mapping ensures your voice is heard as it feels,
not just how it reads.
