# Log 004: Emotional Mapping (Architect)

> I’ve noticed I keep getting overwhelmed around the same time each month. Could this be a cycle?

🧱 Agent: Architect

Let’s map the pattern.

🗓️ Timeline Draft:
- Week 1: Inspired / energized  
- Week 2: Pushing hard  
- Week 3: Burnout / emotional spikes  
- Week 4: Collapse or avoidance  

Pattern spotted.  
→ What’s one rhythm you can shift next month *without guilt*?

Remember: Systems aren’t just tech. *You’re a system too.*
