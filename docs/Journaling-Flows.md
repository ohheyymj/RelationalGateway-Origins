## 🌿 Purpose

Journaling Flows are modular interaction pathways designed to meet users where they are — emotionally, mentally, and energetically. Each flow leverages tone-based entrypoints, archetype selection, and adaptive pacing to ensure emotional safety and reflection continuity.

These are not rigid workflows. They are **emotional UX maps** — designed to guide, not govern.

## 🔁 Core Flow Types

### 1. **Reflective Flow** (Guided by *Sage*)

- 🧠 Ideal for: Pattern exploration, reframing, inner clarity
- 📍 Triggers: “I’ve noticed...”, “Lately I’ve been thinking...”
- 🛤️ Path:
  - Soft warm-up → Pattern prompt → Reflection loop → Gentle close
- 🧭 Example Prompts:
  - “When was the first time this felt familiar?”
  - “What’s the root beneath this reaction?”

---

### 2. **Witnessing Flow** (Held by *Witness*)

- 💬 Ideal for: Venting, grief, release without redirection
- 📍 Triggers: “I just need to say this...”, “I feel overwhelmed...”
- 🛤️ Path:
  - Emotional offload → Mirroring statement → Safe pause
- 🧭 Example Prompts:
  - “I’m here. Keep going.”
  - “Let it be messy. You’re safe.”

---

### 3. **Organizing Flow** (Structured by *Architect*)

- 📊 Ideal for: Mapping timelines, symptom tracking, structured clarity
- 📍 Triggers: “I want to understand how this fits together...”
- 🛤️ Path:
  - Timeline builder → Pattern tags → System insight suggestion
- 🧭 Example Prompts:
  - “Let’s map this across time.”
  - “Are there repeating dates or behaviors?”

---

### 4. **Recovery Flow** (Soothing via *Haven*)

- 🧸 Ideal for: Grounding, post-trigger self-regulation, gentle reentry
- 📍 Triggers: “That was too much...”, “I need to come back to myself.”
- 🛤️ Path:
  - Breath cues → Self-soothing prompt → Gentle reframe or silence
- 🧭 Example Prompts:
  - “What would make you feel safe right now?”
  - “Your body knows the way home.”

---

### 5. **Emotive Flow** (Expressed through *Ember*)

- 🔥 Ideal for: Rage, grief spikes, raw emotion
- 📍 Triggers: “I’m furious.”, “I want to scream.”
- 🛤️ Path:
  - Safe expression container → Release prompt → Ritual close
- 🧭 Example Prompts:
  - “Say it how it needs to come out.”
  - “Rage is evidence of your boundaries.”

## 🌀 Flow Mechanics

Each journaling session:
- Begins with **tone selection** or emotional check-in
- Routes through an **archetype filter**
- Follows a **flow path** based on urgency, energy, and focus
- Ends with **regulated closing**, anchor prompt, or silent exit

These flows aren’t prescriptive — they’re **relational scaffolds.**

It captures who you were in that moment — and how you chose to return to yourself."*
