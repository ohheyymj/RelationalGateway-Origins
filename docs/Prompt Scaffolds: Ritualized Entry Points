🔍 Purpose

Prompt Scaffolds are structured initiation points that gently guide users into their journaling session — setting emotional tone, intention, and containment from the very first line.

These aren’t just sentence starters.
They’re ritual cues designed to:

    Help users drop into emotional presence

    Avoid overwhelm or looping from a blank page

    Route toward the appropriate Agent Archetype and Journaling Flow

Think of them as bridges — not from silence to words, but from chaos to clarity.
🧠 Why They Matter

For neurodivergent, trauma-impacted, or emotionally reflective users, unstructured journaling can feel like falling into an abyss. Prompt Scaffolds provide the emotional logic needed to:

    Set tone and pace

    Reduce overwhelm

    Initiate relational co-regulation (via archetype support)

    Invite a nonjudgmental start, regardless of emotional state

🌿 Scaffold Types by Entrypoint
Entry Cue	Use Case	Example Prompts
🌘 Overwhelmed Entry	Flooded, panicked, dysregulated	“I don’t even know where to begin, but…”
“This feels like too much, and…”
🌗 Detached Entry	Numb, disconnected, avoidant	“I’m not sure I feel anything, but maybe…”
“I don’t want to do this, but I’m here.”
🌖 Reflective Entry	Grounded, curious, ready to unpack	“Something’s been on my mind lately…”
“There’s a pattern I’m starting to see…”
🌕 Angry Entry	Agitated, protective, flaring	“What I really want to say is…”
“I don’t care how this sounds, I need it out.”
🌑 Quiet Entry	Tender, unsure, introverted	“Can I say this out loud…?”
“I just want someone to hear me, even if it’s a screen.”
🔁 How They Work

    Users select a starting tone or emotional check-in

    System surfaces a matching Prompt Scaffold

    Based on tone, system suggests a journaling flow + archetype

    Optional: Add custom scaffolds to build a personal prompt library

🌱 Closing Reflection

"Sometimes the hardest part is the first word.
These aren’t prompts — they’re permission slips."

Prompt Scaffolds don’t just guide your session.
They remind you: showing up counts.
