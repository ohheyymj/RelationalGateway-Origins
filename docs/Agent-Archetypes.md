## What Are Agent Archetypes?

Agent Archetypes are tone-mapped emotional routers designed to guide user input into the correct journaling flow — ensuring emotional resonance, boundary safety, and reflection pacing.

Each archetype carries a distinct energetic signature and responds differently depending on emotional tone, urgency, and context.

## 🔁 Routing Logic

Agents are selected based on:
- Opening tone or selected checkbox
- User prompt content (keywords or tone classifiers)
- Emotional urgency
- Journaling context (reflection vs. offload)

## 🧠 Why It Matters

These agents are more than voices.  
They are **relational UX anchors** — shaping the user’s inner experience, gently steering the journaling interface, and co-creating emotional safety without therapist substitution.

This is **emotional routing as UX architecture.**
