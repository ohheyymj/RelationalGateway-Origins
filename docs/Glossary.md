## 💬 Lexicon: Core System Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Relational UX** | A design philosophy that centers trust, co-regulation, and emotional presence between the system and user. |
| **Archetype Agent** | A symbolic personality used to route emotional tone. Each one carries a distinct energy and guides journaling accordingly. |
| **Journaling Flow** | A structured emotional path that helps guide the pace, prompts, and container for each session. |
| **Prompt Scaffold** | A soft sentence starter that helps ease the user into emotional presence and prevent blank-page overwhelm. |
| **Memory Container** | A bounded space designed to receive intense emotion (grief, rage, confusion) without destabilizing the user. |
| **Tone Mapping** | A signal decoding method that reads user input (text, tone, emoji) and routes them into aligned journaling flows. |
| **System Routing** | The emotional logic that determines which archetype, container, or flow is selected based on user state. |
| **Pattern Tracking** | The act of mapping emotional, behavioral, or cognitive loops across time using tags, timelines, and journaling data. |
| **Soft System** | A system grounded in care, consent, adaptability, and emotional sovereignty — the opposite of command/control logic. |
| **Field Log** | A reflective entry that captures major thresholds, build milestones, or emotional states during system evolution. |
